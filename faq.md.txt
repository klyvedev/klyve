## 1. Security & Intellectual Property

**Q: Does Klyve train on my code?**
**A:** No, Klyve does not train on your code. It runs locally on your machine and stores your specifications and source code in a local, encrypted database. It only sends specific code snippets to the LLM provider you select (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) for the purpose of executing the immediate task, subject to that provider's API privacy policy.

**Q: Can I use Klyve offline?**
**A:** Klyve's internal logic, file management, and database work completely offline. However, the core generative and development capabilities require an internet connection to reach your chosen LLM provider's API.

## 2. Technical Control & Quality

**Q: What prevents Klyve from generating unmaintainable "spaghetti code"?**
**A:** Unlike chat interfaces, Klyve is **State-Aware**.
1.  **Standards:** It strictly adheres to the *Coding Standard* document generated for your specific project.
2.  **Review:** Every block of code passes through automated syntax and style reviews before being committed.
3.  **Context:** It locally retains the context of existing architectural patterns to ensure consistency.

**Q: What happens if the AI generates bugs?**
**A:** Klyve uses a "Human-in-the-Loop" architecture. If the AI cannot solve a debugging problem within your configured limit, the system pauses and escalates to you. You can launch the **Manual Fix** workflow to open the code in your IDE, fix the logic, and resume the sprint.

**Q: Can I change an approved spec document mid-sprint?**
**A:** No. You cannot jump back and redo a document that is already approved. To change the scope, you must either edit the un-implemented backlog item or raise a new Change Request, which triggers a controlled spec update upon completion.

## 3. Operations & Cost

**Q: Is there a monthly subscription?**
**A:** No. The Klyve executable is free to download. Klyve follows a **"Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK)** model. You pay your preferred LLM provider directly for API usage, giving you complete control over costs.

**Q: Which LLMs are supported?**
**A:** Klyve supports several major hosted LLM service providers. You can also configure a **Custom Endpoint** to connect with local models or private cloud instances. You can additionally configure separate models for "Reasoning" and "Quick Tasks" to optimize costs.

## 4. Factory Logic

**Q: How does Klyve determine the implementation plan?**
**A:** Klyve reads your selected Backlog Items and cross-references them with your *Technical Specification*. It uses a planning algorithm to determine the most logical sequence of changes (e.g., *Database Schema → Backend Logic → API Layer*) to minimize dependencies.

**Q: What should I do if a Regression Test fails at the end of a sprint?**
**A:** You have two strategic options:
1.  **Immediate Fix:** Pause, debug manually in your IDE, and retry the test.
2.  **Acknowledge & Deferred Fix:** Ship the sprint as "Completed," but Klyve will automatically log a high-priority **Bug Report** in the backlog for the regression failure.

**Q: How do I handle "State Drift" if I changed code outside of Klyve?**
**A:** When you load a project, Klyve performs a **Pre-flight Check** (requires Git). If it detects uncommitted external changes, it asks you to commit them to ensure its internal understanding remains in sync with the file system.
