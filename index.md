## Beyond Code Generation: Full-Lifecycle Engineering
Current AI tools are largely **Tactical Assistants** - IDE plugins for autocompletion. You are still left managing the big picture alone: architecting systems, wiring components, writing tests, and maintaining documentation..

Klyve is different. It is an **Autonomous Software Engineering System**. You provide a requirement or an architectural guideline; Klyve handles the implementation details across the entire lifecycle.

| Feature | Tactical Assistants (Code Generators) | Klyve (Software Factory) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Role** | The Junior Pair Programmer | The Engineering Team |
| **Input** | Cursor position & open files | App & Tech Specifications & Architecture |
| **Scope** | Single functions or snippets | Entire Project Lifecycle (Spec to Test) |
| **Memory** | Context window limited | Persistent Project State |
| **Testing** | You write the tests | Klyve writes & runs the tests |

## The "10%" Reality
Klyve is designed for the experienced engineer who understands that writing code is only 10% of the job. The other 90% - specification, testing, documentation updates, and integration—is what kills your velocity and requires a team.

### How Klyve changes your workflow:

1.  **You Architect, It Builds**
    You don't tab-complete your way through a project. You provide your high-level requirements and technical specifications (or ask Klyve to do the detailing for you from a summary). Once you approve them, Klyve implements them.

2.  **"Glass Box" Transparency**
    No magic black boxes. Klyve produces standard, readable code that you own. If you stop using Klyve tomorrow, your project artifact remain as a standard repository that any human developer can pick up.

3.  **Full Lifecycle Management**
    Klyve doesn't just write code. It updates your documentation to match the code, generates unit tests, regression tests and UI tests, and runs these as well as your own additional tests to ensure the new features are good.

## Privacy & Security
{: .no_toc }

> **Local-First. Bring Your Own Key.**
>
> Klyve runs locally on your machine. We do not host your code. We do not train on your code.
> * **Your Keys:** You provide your own API keys (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google).
> * **Your Code:** Source files never leave your local environment except to travel to the LLM provider for processing.
> * **Zero Retention:** Klyve does not store your intellectual property on any remote server.
