## The "Assistant" Trap
**You don't need help coding. You need help executing entire projects.**

The current generation of AI coding assistants are limited: they are tactical solutions, not strategic ones. They help you autocomplete a function or refactor a block, but they have no concept of your **Project Architecture**, your **Sprint Goals**, or your need for an **End-to-End Traceability Matrix**.

The result? You code faster, but you spend just as much time debugging integration errors, writing boilerplate tests, and updating stale documentation. You are unabled to get bigger things done.

## Enter the Factory Paradigm
Klyve is not a plugin. It is a standalone **Software Development Factory** where you are the Architect, and AI is the workforce.

Instead of writing code line-by-line, you execute the entire development lifecycle. You approve the specifications, you define the stack, you decide the sprint inclusions and you review the logic plans. Klyve handles the implementation details—managing the backlog, writing the code, executing the regression suite, and committing the results.

### Core Capabilities

### 1. Plan Before You Build
Klyve doesn't guess. It reads your specs, breaks down the implementation, proposes a sprint plan, and waits for your sign-off. If the plan is flawed, you correct it before a single line of code is written.

### 2. State-Aware Context
Unlike chat bots that forget previous details, Klyve remembers what it has done. It knows what it has built earlier, what tests passed, and which files are needed for the current change.

### 3. The "Unhappy Path"
Real development is messy. Klyve includes automated debugging pipelines to handle environment failures, missing dependencies, and regression errors — or it can hand them off to you for a manual fix.

## Built for the "10x" Solo Professional
Klyve is designed specifically for Senior Developers, Architects, and Technical Founders who want to build "Team-Scale" applications single-handedly.

### 🔒 Your IP Stays Local
Klyve is a compiled, desktop-native executable. It runs locally on your Windows or Linux machine.
* **No Cloud State:** Your source code, database, and specs are stored in a local, encrypted SQLite database.
* **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key):** You connect directly to your preferred LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or any other). Klyve acts as the secure conduit; we never see your code.

### 🛠 Control, Not Magic
It can be difficult to work with black box applications delivered by an AI tool. Klyve generates standard, readable code (Python, Java, JS, SQL, or any other language that your chosen LLM can code in) that you own completely.
* **Standards Enforced:** The system adheres to a generated *Coding Standard* specific to your project.
* **Human-in-the-Loop:** Every major decision—from the initial tech stack to the final merge—requires your explicit approval.
