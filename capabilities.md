# Capabilities
{: .fs-9 }

Klyve handles the heavy lifting of software engineering, allowing you to focus on architecture and product decisions.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## 1. Specification & Architecture
Most coding assistants require you to think in code snippets. Klyve thinks in projects.
* **Spec Generation:** Describe your feature either in plain English or upload a fuller  set of requirements, and Klyve converts it into detailed UX/UI, application and technical specifications.
* **Architecture Management:** Klyve maintains the "big picture" of your project structure, ensuring new features fit into your existing design.

## 2. Automated Development
Once a specification is approved, Klyve acts as your implementation team.
* **Code Generation:** Klyve writes functional, standard Python code to match the requirements.
* **Refactoring:** It can update existing code to improve structure or performance without breaking functionality.
* **Dependency Management:** Klyve identifies library imports and requirements automatically.

## 3. The Testing Engine
Klyve ensures reliability through a hybrid testing approach.
* **Unit Tests:** Klyve automatically writes **and** runs unit tests for the code it generates.
* **UI Testing:** For visual elements, Klyve generates detailed **manual test cases** that guide you through verifying the user interface.
* **Custom Integration Tests:** Klyve writes backend or integration test scripts, and executes them automatically as part of the sprint process.

## 4. Documentation and Reporting
Documentation is treated as a first-class citizen, not an afterthought.
* **Live Docs:** As code changes, Klyve updates and versions the corresponding documentation. You can access all project documentation in the Document Hub.
* **Traceability:** You can trace every requirement forward to implemented functions.
* **Reporting:** A Reports Hub provides you with information about project completion, sprint performance, sprint deliverables and backlog requirements traceability. Through the Projects menu you can also access your sprint histories.

## 5. Security & Privacy
* **Secure Storage:** Project document, records and artifacts are stored in a secure local database structure.
* **No Third-Party Sharing:** Klyve does not share artifacts with any remote servers other than the LLM provider you explicitly choose.
* **OS Support:** Klyve is built natively for **Windows** and **Linux**.
